Hypervisor - Virtual Box
Editor - Visual Studio

How I set up my virtual enviornment - Chose Virtual Box, then downloaded both Virtual Box and Vagrant. Chose a Vagrant Box, downloaded and added to Virtual Box through Windows Power Shell in a new, unqiue directory (C:\Users\LMOakes\csn2) using commands such as vagrant add and vagrant init. Then created the virtual enviornment by running vagrant up.
