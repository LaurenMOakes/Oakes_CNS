# Tutorial 1

I used virtual studio in order to create my bootstrap file and had no problem using the vagrant ssh command to gain access 
to my virtual machine, however when I ran the command that was meant to print my html file, nothing would print to screen.
Screenshots are below to showcase my problems and end result.
