# Linux Distribution 
I chose to install Oracle Linux because it had the most helpful documentation as well as online recources to assist further in the homework.

# SCC Tool
When attempting to download the SCC I ran into a problem downloading the vagrant-scp plugin to copy files from my host to my Oracle Linux VM.



If I could succesfully downlaod this plug I would have run the following commands to get my SCC tool succesfully. 

vagrant scp C:\Users\LMOakes\Downloads\scc-5.7.2_macosx10_x86_64_bundle.zip webserver:/home/vagrant
