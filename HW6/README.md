HW6 - SEIM Fundamentals & Tuning

## Splunk Course 1 - What is Splunk?
This course was very short and did not include an assesment, however, through this course I learned about machine data and how splunk increases operational intelligence in an organization. Machine data is a data that is automaticallly generated by machines which can be structured, but is often not. If not structured, this data can be very difficult to read and understand. So in order to increase operational intelligence or solve problems in less time, Splunk offers a way to structure your organizations machine data. This allows you to shift through logs and find events that correspond to errors or complaints, which means problems can be identified quicker and forwarded directly to party responsible for fixing them. 

## Splunk Course 2 - Intro to Splunk
  This course provided much more information and an assesment at the end, some key takeaways I got from this course are basic Splunk info, query intro, and how Splunk deals with data. At its most basic, Splunk structures data into events by sourcetype to allow an easy way to query, search or perform actions on the data. There are three main roles in Splunk, the admin - installs apps, injects data, and creates knowledge objects, the power - creates and shares knowledge objects to users of an app, and creates real time searches, and the user - can see own and shared knowledge objects. A knowledge object is anything that is used to describe the data such as data interpretation, data classification, data enrichment, data models, and or data normalization. These knowledge objects are named, created and removed by a knowledge manager and can be created and shared to users to be saved and reused in multiple apps including searching.

  When searching you can control your results by toggling between different views including events, patterns, statistics, and visualization. You can also use subsearches to get more specific info based on fields like index, host, source, and sourcetype. Hoewver, the best way to get good results is to search based on time periods of suspected event or issue. Too further restrict or broaden search there are three search modes: fast - doesn't include field discovery, verbose - includes as many fields as possible, and smart - toggles between two other modes depending on each search. One a search is compelted it will need to be refreshed every 10 minutes can be shared in a report or visualized in a dashboard to save results. 

## Windows Event ID Excluded 
  Event ID 5156 - Windows Filtering Platform
  I chose to exclude this Security Windows event because I don't believe it is necessary for our system. Bascially what this Event ID does is it logs when the Windows Filtering Paltform (bascially a firewall) allows a network connection, and so everytime there is a succesful connection an event will be created which in my opinion will create too much unnecesarry events for one security framework. 

## Screenshot of input.conf on NUC
  The screenshot below shows our inputs.conf file on my nuc. The code necessary to exclude a Windows Event ID is name_of_blacklist = EventCode = "####" . Each code will need to be blacklisted under its corresponding log section (Application, System, Security, Setup). This file was uploaded on every nuc workstation and both vm's.
